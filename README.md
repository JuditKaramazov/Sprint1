# Sprint 1 IT Academy | Web Design 1


## Getting started with HTML and CSS

It's impossible to ignore the fact that the layout of a website defines its structure, organizing the information and providing clear navigation paths while still conveying a message through eye-catching visuals. However, what's also unquestionable is that we all need a starting point before being capable of building something personal, solid, and unique enough.
According to these principles, IT Academy's first sprint consisted of creating a responsive layout devoted to the essence of design architecture, which presented the crucial points every front-end developer should know.

Firstly, we had to work on a small wireframe to truly understand the concept of the `box model` applying to block boxes and how the different parts of a box work together. Secondly, it was necessary to introduce some essential concepts, like `Responsive Web Design` and `Media Queries`. Thanks to it, we could interiorize the importance of working both on tablet and mobile devices:

As seen above, the very first exercises allowed us to get a clearer idea of how a website should be structured, which qualified us to work on a final version of the proposed website they wanted us to replicate:

It's not much, but it's honest work! Hopefully, there will be some alternate versions and variations in the future that will be possible thanks to this very first layout; eventually, and not without tons of effort, we all will be capable of delivering original sites and noteworthy ideas. As stated before, though, there is no way to get to that point without even trying to start moving.
To everyone that just started diving into this fascinating world, remember: `don't give up, skeleton`, and don't forget that your very first projects are as important as the ones you'll be crafting in the (near!) future.
